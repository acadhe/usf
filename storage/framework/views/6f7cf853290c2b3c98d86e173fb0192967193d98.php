					<p>Urban Communities of Practice</p>
					<p>Privacy Policy</p>
					<p>Effective on: 2 October 2016</p>
					<p>
						We recognize that your privacy is very important and we take it seriously. We respect yours and we want to earn your trust that we are careful with your data.
					</p>
					<p>
						This policy sets out our privacy policies and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our sites, services, and content (“Services”). We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
					</p>

						What We May Collect and Use
					</p>
					<p>
						We collect information about what CoP pages you access, information about your device (such as browser type), and information you send us such as an email address used to register or communicate with us, full name, and photos.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you use CoP Services, we may collect and store your Internet Protocol address. We may use this information to fight spam and other abuse; to personalize CoP Services; or to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use CoP Services.
					</p>

				<section id="email">
					<p class="heading-tos">
						Email from CoP
					</p>
					<p>
						We’ll send administrative emails about account or service changes, or new policies. You can’t opt out of them. We won’t email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, send it to us so we can investigate.
					</p>
					<p class="heading-tos">
						Disclosure of Your Information
					</p>
					<p>
						We don’t share your personal information such as email outside the company. We won’t sell your personal information.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; or (2) when it is required by law, such as pursuant to a legal process.
					</p>
					<p>
						If we’re going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you advance notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We will object to requests for information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.
					</p>
					<p>
						If we merge with another company such that your information will become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="cookies">
					<p class="heading-tos">Cookies</p>
					<p>
						We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels and local storage to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in and remember your preferences.
					</p>
					<p>
						We respect Do Not Track (“DNT”) settings in browsers. If you’re logged out of our Services and have DNT enabled, we will not set cookies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by CoP only and not the use of cookies by third parties.
					</p>
					<p class="heading-tos">Cookies</p>
					<p>
						CoP uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run CoP.
					</p>
					<p class="heading-tos">Modifying Your Personal Information or Deleting Your Account</p>
					<p>
						If you have an CoP account, you can access and modify your personal information, or delete your account on your Profile Setting. To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. If you delete your account, your account and content may be unrecoverable.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="changes-this-policy">
					<p class="heading-tos">Changes to This Policy</p>
					<p>
						UCoP may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it.
